It took me over a decade of professional life to discover something that I wanted to study. I'm now on my second career as a self-taught software developer.</p> <p>I have proven to myself that I can make it as a developer without formal education. But I am left wanting more. It's not about money: I don't think six years of a part-time degree would produce a monetary increase that I couldn't achieve through professional experience and grit in the meantime.</p> <p>This dilemma has played on my mind for a while now. I want knowledge. I want to identify unknown unknowns . I am attracted to the structure that education provides. But I don't want the financial burden of university \u2014 I especially don't want to pay for modules I have essentially obtained through personal study and experience.</p> <p>An idea began to grow: could I do this on my own? </p> <p>A quick search on eBay confirmed I could obtain second-hand materials for Open University modules and other university-level textbooks are available for purchase online too. Large Language Models such as ChatGPT are potentially good-enough for my needs as a tutor/professor.</p> <p>Are you saying we don't need professors anymore?</p> <p>Just to be clear, AI cannot currently replace the expertise and wisdom of an experienced university professor. Perhaps one day. But not today. AI is, however, at a point where it can provide additional insight through investigative conversations, and confirm understanding through targeted Q&amp;A sessions.</p> <p>I created my own GPT . I instructed it to behave like a CS professor and guide me to answers rather than regurgitate facts. I can even give it photos of pages in books and it will generate questions to test my comprehension! As I learn more about configuring GPTs, I will be able to improve its effectiveness.</p> <p>Next, I just needed a curriculum. I used Open University as my baseline to linearise topics. I compared their various Computing &amp; IT pathways and chose the most relevant modules for my career plans. Most of these modules have reading material available second-hand. I then used resources such as Teach Yourself CS  to identify additional materials to study. I spent some time deciding how deep I would go into each topic and disregarded a few recommendations that I felt would be overkill for my needs. I created a three-stage curriculum.</p> <p>Then I began to diverge from the typical university pathway. I began to include books considered by most to be must-reads for anyone working with code. And I fit them around the structure I had already defined.</p> <p></p> <p>But there are so many non-technical skills that compliment a career in software: leadership, finance and business to name a few. So I created a fourth stage to capture these additional skills. This stage is unstructured and designed to be studied as and when I desire. If I need a break from data structures, I'll study business or leadership. Why not?</p> <p>I published the whole curriculum on my website and called it The Self-Taught Pathway. Each \"module\" has a tick box next to it so I can track my progress. I imagine it'll take me years! </p> <p>Knowledge for its own sake is futile. It needs a higher purpose. Yes, it will make me a more competent developer, but there's also an opportunity here. Considering my \"Self-Taught Pathway\" will lack the status of a formal qualification, I need to prove my competence another way.</p> <p>So as I progress through each module, I shall do what any good student does: I'll take notes, converse with \"Professor GPT\", summarise content and rewrite it in my own words to confirm understanding. And then I will publish it all online. My website has been designed to become a hub of knowledge as I go through this process. Being a resource for both myself and others on their own self-taught journey.</p> <p>What a world we live in.

When AI can be creative intentionally, instead of on the back of hallucinations . When it can generate production-ready code consistently and communicate clearly to stakeholders. Could devs be out of a job? </p> <p>These game developers  are already pushing the limits of what AI can do. And my gut tells me that some companies will push it to the extreme. If there is a buck to be made someone will want to be the first to prove it.  Let's look at some possible consequences if this happened across the industry.</p> <p>Programming languages have \"Core Devs\": teams of people who maintain, update and improve the programming languages themselves. Their most important job is implementing security patches. They also fix bugs, improve usability etc. If AI inherits developer jobs, maybe it will inherit the job of a core dev too. Being responsible for the very code that it generates. Can AI be held responsible? </p> <p>Maybe AI will do away with the need for programming languages and default to writing machine code . Arguably, all languages are designed to be human-readable and add overhead as a result. If a human doesn't need to read it, then why bother? You'll get more efficient code.</p> <p>I hope this never happens \u2014 no matter the autonomy given to a system, we should always be able to verify what it's doing and why.</p> <p>How will innovation fare?

They often face large amounts of push back until the world either accepts the inevitable or gets onboard with the idea. Could AI innovations be as impactful as the lightbulb, the telephone or the internet?</p> <p>Maybe human innovation will flourish! There might be a world ahead of us where AI takes on so much of the mundane that humans are freed from the repetitive and empowered to innovate full-time. My job as a dev would be one of AI-empowered innovation.</p> <p>The future is a mystery. Questions abound more than answers. This may always be the case.

Let me demonstrate using a concept with which most of us should be familiar.</p> <p>As children we are initially taught to recognise single letters. We go over them again and again to ensure we recognise them visually and audibly. At this early stage, each letter is a Chunk of information. Eventually we memorise the letters and our parents and teachers can point to a letter at random and we immediately vocalise its phonic. Then we start to string those letters together into words.</p> <p>To begin with it's a lengthy task of processing each letter one by one before we know what the word is.
